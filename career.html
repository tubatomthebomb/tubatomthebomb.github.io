	<p> Ever since I started playing guitar, I've wanted to build guitars too. Being a "luthier",
	 which is the official name of a professional guitar crafter/repairman. to me, being a luthier
	 is a way to be in the music field, use my hands to build something, and not work in an 
	 office for my whole life. I plan on Starting my own buisness and Owning my own workshop.
	 One benefit of being in a job like this, I can make my own hours, allowing me to be more of family man.
	 I'm already starting to build guitars as a hobby, and soon enough I will be selling them as my own product
	 and growing my buisness for the future.
