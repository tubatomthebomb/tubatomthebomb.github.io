	 <h2> Thomas McKnight: the man, the myth, the legend</h2>
	 <p> My name is Thomas Mcknight. I take pride in 4 things, those 4 things are cooking, guitar, tuba,
	 and the ability to sleep more than 24 hours at a time. Yes that last one is a true story but that story is
	 for another time and place. Anyways, some other facts about me is that I am slightly fluent in german,
     I write music for guitar and I am forming together a band with a few peers. I guess you could say I am a music
     nerd, but music is what enjoy in life, it's what wakes me up in the morning, keeps me going through the day,
     and I can fall asleep to it. Well thats my life in a nutshell, more info about me in side bar tabs. </p>
